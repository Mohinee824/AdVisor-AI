- Ran run_all.sh on Ubuntu 20.04
- Python 3.9.7, TensorFlow 2.10.0, OpenCV 4.5.5
- All modules passed; final forecast.csv generated
Stage your changes:
bash
git add integration/run_all.sh integration/CHANGELOG.txt
Commit:
bash
git commit -m "Set up integration script and folder structure"
Push your branch:
bash
git push origin integration-setup
Open a Pull Request for review and merge.
If you initialized Git earlier:
bash
git add integration/
git commit -m "Setup integration script and folder structure"
Later you can create a GitHub repo, add it as a remote (git remote add origin <URL>), and push.
Next Steps
Swap in Member Code
Coordinate with each teammate in this order: Member 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.
Replace each stub script (in memberX_*/) with their actual implementation.
After swapping, run ./run_all.sh, fix any errors (path mismatches, missing dependencies).
Add Environment Setup
At the top of integration/run_all.sh, add:
bash
# Activate virtual environment
source ../venv/bin/activate
Or add system checks for required binaries (python3, ffmpeg, etc.).
Finalize Integration
Remove any stub echo logging if you prefer real-time console logs only.
Update integration/CHANGELOG.txt with final integration notes: versions, flags, known issues.
Document & Present
In your project README, explain how to run the pipeline:
bash
cd integration
./run_all.sh
Prepare Slide 3 (Hardware/Software Requirements) and Slide 4 (Architecture Diagram).
Prepare for Review 1 (5–8 Aug)
Ensure all teammates can run the pipeline end-to-end.
Collect sample outputs: member3_detections.csv, member5_forecast.csv, sample annotated image, etc.
Populate your demo dashboard (Member 6) with these outputs.
2025-09-03: Integrated real outputs from Members 2–4
  - Verified frame extraction, detection, and KPI aggregation
  - Forecasting module pending
  - All paths and outputs confirmed
