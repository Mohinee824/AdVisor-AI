## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-04
### Added
- Initial public release of **AdVisor-AI**: an end-to-end pipeline for brand logo detection, KPI computation, and forecasting from video
- `run_all.sh` script for orchestrating the full workflow across modules
- Modular folder structure with `member2_frames`, `member3_detection`, `member4_kpis`, `member5_forecast`, `member6_app`, and `yolov5`
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md` for documentation and version tracking
- Forecasting visualizations saved to `member5_forecast/reports/figures/`

### Fixed
- Path resolution issues in `run_forecast.py` and `compute_kpis.py`
- Non-numeric data handling in KPI forecasting
- File misplacement caused by virtual environment execution context

### Notes
- Default branch is `master`
- Forecasting warnings are expected due to integer-based indices and do not affect output integrity

---

## [0.9.3] - 2025-09-03
### Added
- Finalized `run_forecast.py` with CLI arguments and robust error handling
- Multi-panel KPI forecast plot generation
- Confidence interval computation using Holt-Winters residuals
- `requirements.txt` capturing all dependencies

### Changed
- Renamed output file from `member4_kpis.csv` to `brand_kpis.csv`
- Updated `run_all.sh` to reflect new file paths and naming conventions

---

## [0.9.2] - 2025-09-02
### Added
- KPI computation logic using grouped appearance IDs and frame gaps
- Auto-detection of latest YOLOv5 `exp*/raw_detections.csv` folder
- Aggregation of start/end frames, duration, and average confidence

### Fixed
- `KeyError: 'brand_name'` by switching to `class_name` from detection output
- CSV parsing issues due to missing headers and inconsistent formats

---

## [0.9.1] - 2025-08-31
### Added
- YOLOv5 detection integration with `detect.py` and custom weights
- CSV output enabled via `--save-csv` flag
- Detection results stored in `runs/detect/exp*/raw_detections.csv`

### Changed
- Updated detection script to use video source instead of image folder
- Adjusted confidence thresholds for better logo filtering

---

## [0.8.0] - 2025-08-28
### Added
- Frame extraction module using OpenCV
- CLI support for video input, output directory, and frame indexing
- `frames_index.csv` to track frame timestamps and IDs

### Fixed
- Frame skipping bug due to incorrect FPS handling
- Output folder creation logic to avoid overwrite errors

---

## [0.7.0] - 2025-08-25
### Added
- Initial folder structure and module naming conventions
- Git repo initialized locally with `.gitignore` and `README.md`
- YOLOv5 submodule added via `git submodule add`

---

## [0.6.0] - 2025-08-20
### Added
- Roboflow dataset imported and structured under `member3_detection/dataset`
- `data.yaml` configured for training and validation splits
- Label files organized under `train/labels` and `valid/labels`

---

## [0.5.0] - 2025-08-18
### Added
- YOLOv5 training initiated with custom brand logo dataset
- `best.pt` weights generated and saved to `member3_detection/`
- Training logs and metrics reviewed for model tuning

---

## [0.4.0] - 2025-08-15
### Added
- Project ideation and naming: **AdVisor-AI**
- Defined pipeline stages: frame extraction → detection → KPI → forecasting → frontend
- Initial planning documents and module breakdowns created
